EPL361 / TEAM I / PROTOTYPE v1
------------------------------
This is the ptototype of the SCAJA's (Social Context-Aware Jobfinder Application) website. The website is not uploaded to the internet yet.

To create our website we used templates from http://www.free-css.com/ and we made changes to the ".css" and ".html" files. We modified most parts of the ".html" and we kept only the background and the general style from ".css" files. We declare that we don't own the origin templates and their licenses.

There is a "Log in" page, in which the user can sign in using his LinkedIn's account. By pressing the "sign in" button, he aggrees to let us use his personal info from his LinkedIn's profile. It also opens a new page, the "search" page. No username or password check is implemented in this prototype version (version 1).

In the "search" page, the user can see job recommendations that match his skills. He can search for a job using specific attributes about his skills, education, location and the category of job that he want to find. For employers, they can view who applied for their job. None of the above operations have been implemented in this prototype version (version 1).
